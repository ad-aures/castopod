Each level accepts one or more fields, identified by a key.

```json
{
  "settings": {
    "general": { // general settings form
      "field-key": {
        "type": "text", // default field type: a text input
        "label": "Enter a text"
      },
      …
    },
    "podcast": {…}, // settings form for each podcast
    "episode": {…}, // settings form for each episode
  }
}
```

The `general`, `podcast`, and `episode` settings are of `Fields` object with
each property being a field key and the value being a `Field` object.
