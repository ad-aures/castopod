}

{
    // …
}
```

### `rssBeforeItem`

using the given Episode object.

Here is a good place to alter the Episode object.

```php
public function rssBeforeItem(Episode $episode): void
{
    // …
}
```

### `rssAfterItem`

This hook is executed after rendering an `<item>`'s tags in the Podcast RSS
feed.

```php
public function rssAfterItem(Epsiode $episode, RssFeed $item): void
{
    // …
}
