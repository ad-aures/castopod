title: plugins.json
---

`plugins.json` declares which plugins are intended for installation and the
version ranges they have to satisfy. It is human-edited, concise, and designed
for sharing intent across environments.

## Example

```json
// writable/plugins.json
{
  "plugins": {
    "acme/hello-world": "2.1.0",
    "ad-aures/custom-rss": "^1.0.0",
    "ad-aures/show-notes-signature": "dev-main"
  },
  "repositories": {}
}
```

## Properties

### `plugins`

A mapping of plugin identifiers to version ranges, expressing intent for what to
install. Keys use the vendor/plugin naming convention; values accept semantic
version ranges or development versions like `dev-main`.

### `repositories`

An array of additional plugin sources to consult when resolving versions.
