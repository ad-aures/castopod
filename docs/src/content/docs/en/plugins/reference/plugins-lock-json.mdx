title: plugins-lock.json
---

`plugins-lock.json` records the exact versions and artifact locations that were
resolved and installed, ensuring repeatable environments across machines and
deployments. It is generated and updated by tooling, not hand-edited.

## Example

```json
// manifest-lock.json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "plugins": {
    "ad-aures/custom-rss": {
      "version": "dev-main",
      "source": {
        "url": "https://github.com/ad-aures/castopod-plugins.git",
        "reference": "20433933ab4e42bb44f8367ab72ee1ffae723019"
      },
      "dist": {
        "url": "https://plugins.castopod.org/static/plugins/db/cf/15/ad-aures_custom-rss_dev-main.zip",
        "path": "",
        "checksum": "dbcf153694f09c5788e6cccbca2db4cb9605faa7c1399d59960edee00fa9f853"
      }
    }
    // ...
  }
}
```

## Properties

### `version`

The lockfile schema version, used by tooling to parse and validate the file
across releases; not related to any plugin version. Changing schema may alter
field shapes or semantics.

### `plugins`

A mapping from a plugin identifier to a locked entry that captures the exact
resolved version, the source and distribution details. This section is the
authoritative record for reinstalls.

Each plugin entry contains:

    - `version`: The exact version (or branch reference such as dev-main) that was resolved and installed for this plugin, guaranteeing consistent reinstallation.

    - `source`: Describes the canonical source of the plugin’s code used to produce the distribution artifact.
        - `url`: The upstream Git repository.
        - `path`: The root path of the plugin.
        - `reference`: The exact commit or revision used, for provenance and reproducibility.
    - `dist`: Points to the installable artifact and verifies its integrity.
        - `url`: A direct link to the packaged plugin archive that the installer downloads.
        - `checksum`: A cryptographic hash of the archive used to validate integrity and prevent tampering during install.
