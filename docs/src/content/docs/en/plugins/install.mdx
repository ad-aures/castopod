title: Install plugins

The recommended way to add and maintain plugins is via the CLI for speed,
reliability, and reproducible setups. A manual file-based method is also
available if terminal access isn’t possible.

- [CLI](#cli): install, update, remove, or sync all plugins from a configuration
  file for consistent environments.

- [Manual](#install-manually-drag-and-drop): place the plugin folder in the
  correct path; Castopod detects valid plugins automatically.

Use the CLI when server access is available; it supports version pinning and
reproducible setups via configuration files.

With that, plugins are automatically tracked in two writable configuration files
whenever you run the commands:

- [`plugins.json`](./reference/plugins-json): lists the plugins you want to use,
  along with their version requirements. Think of it as a _wish list_ of
  plugins.

- [`plugins-lock.json`](./reference/plugins-lock-json): records the exact
  versions that were actually installed, along with extra metadata. This ensures
  that even if a plugin is updated later, Castopod can reproduce the same
  working setup you had before.

### Commands

- Install the latest compatible version of a plugin:

  ```sh
  php spark plugins:add acme/hello-world
  ```

- Install a specific version in order to pin environments:

  ```sh
  php spark plugins:add acme/hello-world@1.0.0
  ```

- Update a plugin to the latest available release:

  ```sh
  php spark plugins:update acme/hello-world
  ```

- Completely remove an installed plugin:

  ```sh
  php spark plugins:remove acme/hello-world
  ```

- Install all plugins listed in [`plugins.json`](./reference/plugins-json):

  ```sh
  php spark plugins:install
  ```

<Aside type="note">

By default, all commands use the
[official Castopod plugin repository](https://plugins.castopod.org/) as the
source for discovery, version resolution, and downloads.

You can edit the default repository by setting it in your .env:

```ini
plugins.repositoryUrl="YOUR_CUSTOM_REPOSITORY_URL"
```

## Install manually (drag-and-drop)

If you only have FTP access or prefer a simple approach:

1. Download the plugin from
   [**plugins.castopod.org**](https://plugins.castopod.org/).

2. Place the plugin folder inside your Castopod installation at:  
   `plugins/{vendor}/{plugin-name}/`
