title: Share your plugin

import { Aside } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

After taking some time to create your plugin, you may want to share it with the
community for other podcasters to enjoy!

You can choose to make your plugin discoverable by submitting it to the
[official Castopod plugin repository](https://plugins.castopod.org/) so that
other podcasters can install it in a few clicks or with one
[CLI command](./install#cli).

## Before submitting

The official Castopod plugin repository has stricter requirements than than the
ones needed for a plugin to merely load in Castopod; it also requires rich
metadata to improve search, categorization, and discovery.

<Aside type="note">

Quick refresher: skim through
[“Anatomy of a plugin”](./#anatomy-of-a-castopod-plugin) to confirm basic
structure and required files before proceeding.

### Requirements for the official repository

**Your plugin must be hosted in a public Git repository.** Private or local
repositories cannot be crawled or indexed by the official repository.

Having said that, make sure to go through the following list to check that
everything is ready for indexing.

#### Required files

- `manifest.json` with the following required properties:
  - `name` (vendor/plugin)
  - `version` (semantic version; must match a Git tag to be listed)
  - `description` (one concise sentence)
  - `minCastopodVersion` (minimum compatible Castopod version)
  - `hooks` (declared hooks the plugin implements)
  - `license` (SPDX identifier or license name, matching the LICENSE file)
- `Plugin.php` (main class; implementing the declared hooks)
- `LICENSE.md` (matches the license declared in the manifest)

#### Optional (recommended)

- `README.md` (what it does, install/config steps, usage examples, changelog,
  etc.)
- `icon.svg` (squared, readable at small sizes; displayed as a ~64x64 circle)

#### Encouraged

- `i18n/` translations (e.g., `en.json`, `fr.json`) to reach more users across
  the globe!

## Submit

When everything is ready, submit at:
[plugins.castopod.org/submit](https://plugins.castopod.org/submit)

Provide the plugin’s Git repository URL and the path to its `manifest.json` if
needed (the plugin’s root directory).

## After submission

The repository is queued for crawling; within a few moments, the plugin should
be indexed.

During crawling, automated checks validate structure and metadata; all Git tags
are scanned and each release is bundled as a zip file and listed as a version.

<Aside type="note">

Only tags that follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) are listed as
releases. Name tags like `1.0.0` or `v1.0.0` (prefixed with a lowercase `v` if
that makes you happy!).
