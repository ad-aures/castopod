## What is an instance?

Your podcast is hosted on your sever and connected to the [Fediverse](fediverse) in what is called an _instance_.
Your instance can manage multiple podcasts, people and users, and host additional pages found on all of your podcasts.

Managing your instance, including podcasts, people, and users is separate from the settings for each
individual podcast.
