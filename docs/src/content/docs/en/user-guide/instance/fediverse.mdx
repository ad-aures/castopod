## What is the Fediverse?

Wikipedia defines the Fediverse as:

> The fediverse is a collection of social networking services that can
> communicate with each other using a common protocol, ActivityPub. Users of
> different websites can send and receive status updates, multimedia files and
> other data across the network.

Your podcast is connected to the Fediverse and, for example, Mastodon users can
subscribe to your handle and will receive a message every time your podcast
publishes a new episode. You can also broadcast messages to your followers on
the Fediverse from your [home page](../website#home). Mastodon users can like
and share your posts.

## Manage Fediverse Blocks

You can choose to unblock a user by pressing the `Unblock` button.
