Roles and permissions in Castopod are defined in two ways, **Instance** users and
[**Podcast**. contributors](../podcast/contributors.md). For a detailed list of permissions, view
he [Auth](/docs/en/getting-started/auth) page.

## Adding a User to the instance

You can add a user to your instance by choosing `Users` -> `New User` from the left hand navigation menu. There
are three roles you can assign to an instance user:

- **Super Admin**: This user has complete control over Castopod including adding or removing podcasts or users.
- **Manager**: This user can manage Castopod's content, such as adding or importing a new podcast and managing people.
- **Podcaster**: This is for general users of Castopod who can access the admin interface.
