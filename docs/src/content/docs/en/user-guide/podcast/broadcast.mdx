## Add your podcast to podcast directories

Listeners can add your RSS feed to their podcast app of choice to subscribe to
your podcast. Most listeners will find your podcast in a podcast directory, such
as Apple Podcasts, YouTube Music, Spotify, or the Podcast Index. These four are
the most popular podcast directories and a number of other directories pull
their data from Apple Podcasts.

Visit [Podnews](https://podnews.net/article/all-the-podcast-directories) to
learn how to add your podcast to most of the podcast directories.

Once your podcast is listed in the podcast directories, you can link to them on
your home page by choosing `Broadcast` from the left hand navigation.

### Podcasting Apps

Castopod provides the ability to link to a majority of podcast directories where
users can find your podcast. For each directory listed fill out the link to your
podcast in a specific directory and the ID. If you want an icon displayed on
your home page, toggle `Display in podcast homepage?`.

After pressing `Save` in the upper right hand corner, visit your home page to
see the icons with hyperlinks on the right hand side of your home page under
_Listen on_.

### Social Networks

If your podcast has a presence on social networks, Castopod provides the ability
to link to your social network profiles. Add the link to your profile page in
the text field and toggle if you want it displayed on your home page.

After pressing `Save` in the upper right hand corner, visit your home page to
see the icons with hyperlinks on the right hand side of your home page under
_Find your podcast on_.
