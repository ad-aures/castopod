When you choose your podcast from the Admin dashboard you will be redirected to the Podcast dashboard page.

The Podcast dashboard shows you up to five of the latest episodes, both those published and scheduled. You can click
on any of these episodes to view them or click `See all episodes` to see a list of every episode.

## Edit your podcast

To edit your podcast, press `Edit podcast` in the upper right hand corner or `Edit podcast` in the left hand side
navigation.

You can edit any of the [fields you filled out when creating your podcast](../instance/podcast).

When finished press the `Save podcast` button in the upper right hand corner.

You can also choose to delete your podcast by pressing `Delete podcast` at the bottom of the Edit podcast page.

## Manage persons

If you have added people to Persons in the Admin dashboard, you can assign them a role here. People assigned roles
will show up on the [Credits page](../website/credits) linked from your home page to give them
credit for contributing to the podcast.

Roles include Administration, Audio production, cast, guests, hosts, writing, and more.

From the **Persons** drop down, choose the person you want to add. Then choose a role from the \*_Roles_ drop down and
press `Add person(s)`.

A list of all people assigned roles will be displayed. You can remove them by pressing the `Remove` button.

Adding persons to your podcast populates the Credits page linked from your
[home page](../website).

## Podcast imports

Podcast imports show you the status of a feed that you imported into Castopod, including the feed name,
how long the import took, and how many episodes were imported. Under **Actions** you can try re-import the feed
if the original import failed or delete the status message for the imported feed.

If the feed you imported has been updated after your import, press `Synchronize Feeds` in the upper right hand
corner to import the missing episodes.

## Sync feeds

You can also synchronize missing episode from an imported feed by choosing `Sync Feeds` from the Podcast dashboard
menu. The **Feed URL** should auto-populate if you have previously imported a feed. Press `Add to queue` to import
any missing episodes from the feed.
