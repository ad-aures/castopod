## All Episodes

To view a list of all episodes, click `All Episodes`. Each episode will be
displayed in a list with its name and notes, Visibility such as published or
scheduled, and how many downloads and comments each episode has.

### Actions and the Episode Dashboard

Click the three dots under **Actions** to view a menu of options for an episode
or click on an individual episode to view the available actions:

- **Go to page**: This will redirect you to the public page of the episode and
  display the show notes.

copy the code to your clipboard. Insert the code into a web page to display the
episode.

### Persons

If you have added [people in the Admin interface](../instance/persons), you can
choose a person and assign them a role, such as guest, for a given episode. When
persons are assigned to an episode, a link will be displayed on the episode page
listing the person's name and role and they will be listed in the Credits page.
Adding persons to an episode page is optional.

### Video clips and Soundbites

The process to create a video clip and soundbite is the same. It may take a
minute for the file to load and you will see the waveform.

A video clip will create an MP4 video of the audio with text from the transcript
matched to the audio. A soundbite will create an audio clip.

Enter the name of the clip you want to create. Then drag the slider to where you
want to start and end your video clip or soundbite. You can press the `Play`
button to preview your clip.

For video clips, choose a format, including Landscape, Portrait or Squared and a
background theme color.

Then press the `Create` button, you will be redirected to a status page
displaying the status of creating the clip. Refresh the page to see if it's
`Running` or completed. You may need to be patient depending on the length of
the clip.

<Aside>

To create video clips and soundbites, your server must have `FFMPEG` installed
and a transcript.
