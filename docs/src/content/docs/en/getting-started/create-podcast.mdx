sequential order.

### Medium

Choose the type of audio for your podcast:

- **Podcast**: a standard podcast.

## Classification

### Other categories (optional)

You can choose a second category in addition to the main category you set up.

### Parental advisory

Choose if your podcast has explicit content or swearing or choose Clean if your podcast is suitable for everyone. You
can also choose to leave this category as undefined. When [creating a new episode](../podcast/episodes.md),
you will also have the opportunity to choose clean, explicit, or undefined on a per episode basis.

## Author

### Owner name and email

Enter the owner name and email in the provided fields. This is only visible in the RSS feed and is used by other
podcasting platforms to verify your ownership of your podcast. You can choose to remove the owner email
from the public RSS feed by using the provided toggle.

### Publisher

If your podcast is part of a podcast network or is produced by a company, enter the publisher here.

### Copyright

You can optionally add the copyright holder in this field.

### Fediverse identity

Enter the handle (or nickname) for your podcast. This will allow people on Mastodon and other Fediverse services
to follow your podcast. Your handle will be shown as @yourdomain.com@handle on the Fediverse.

To learn more about Fediverse integration, visit the [Fediverse documentation page](../instance/fediverse.md).

### Podcast banner

Upload a banner image to be displayed at the top of your podcast's home page. The banner must have a 3:1 ration and
be at least 1500px wide.

### Premium

Toggle this setting to set all episodes by default as premium. When creating an episode, it will default to premium,
and you can still choose to make some episodes, trailers, or bonus content as free and public.

## Open Podcast Prefix Project (OP3)

The [Open Podcast Prefix Project](https://op3.dev) is an open source and trusted third party analytics service. If
you toggle this to enabled, you will be able to view analytics for your podcast over time including the number of
listens over time, episode comparison charts, and more.

## Location

You can optionally add a real or fictitious location name in this field. When
[creating a new episode](../podcast/episodes.md) you also can add a location to an individual episode.

## Advanced Parameters

You can optionally toggle the following settings:

- **Prevent podcast from being copied**: this locks your podcast and does not allow other podcast platforms to import
  your podcast. If you decide in the future to migrate away from Castopod to a new platform, this toggle will need to be
  unchecked.
- **Podcast should be hidden from public catalogues**: If toggled, a best effort is made to hide the entire podcast from
  appearing in Apple Podcasts, YouTube Music, and any other third party podcast apps. (Not guaranteed)
- **Podcast will not be having new episodes**: If your podcast comes to an end, you can toggle this to let listeners
  know there will not be new episodes.
