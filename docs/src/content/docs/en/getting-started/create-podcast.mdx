sequential order.

  within the album.

  represent chapters within a book.

## Classification

### Language

From the dropdown menu, choose which language is spoken in your podcast.

### Category

Choose the category that represents your podcast, such as Arts, Comedy, Sports,
Technology, etc.

### Other categories (optional)

You can choose a second category in addition to the main category you set up.

### Parental advisory

Choose if your podcast has explicit content or swearing or choose Clean if your
podcast is suitable for everyone. You can also choose to leave this category as
undefined. When [creating a new episode](../podcast/episodes), you will also
have the opportunity to choose clean, explicit, or undefined on a per episode
basis.

## Author

### Owner name and email

Enter the owner name and email in the provided fields. This is only visible in
the RSS feed and is used by other podcasting platforms to verify your ownership
of your podcast. You can choose to remove the owner email from the public RSS
feed by using the provided toggle.

### Publisher

If your podcast is part of a podcast network or is produced by a company, enter
the publisher here.

### Copyright

You can optionally add the copyright holder in this field.

### Fediverse identity

Enter the handle (or nickname) for your podcast. This will allow people on
Mastodon and other Fediverse services to follow your podcast. Your handle will
be shown as @yourdomain.com@handle on the Fediverse.

To learn more about Fediverse integration, visit the
[Fediverse documentation page](../instance/fediverse).

### Podcast banner

Upload a banner image to be displayed at the top of your podcast's home page.
The banner must have a 3:1 ration and be at least 1500px wide.

### Premium

Toggle this setting to set all episodes by default as premium. When creating an
episode, it will default to premium, and you can still choose to make some
episodes, trailers, or bonus content as free and public.

## Open Podcast Prefix Project (OP3)

The [Open Podcast Prefix Project](https://op3.dev) is an open source and trusted
third party analytics service. If you toggle this to enabled, you will be able
to view analytics for your podcast over time including the number of listens
over time, episode comparison charts, and more.

## Location

You can optionally add a real or fictitious location name in this field. When
[creating a new episode](../podcast/episodes) you also can add a location to an
individual episode.

## Advanced Parameters

You can optionally toggle the following settings:

- **Prevent podcast from being copied**: this locks your podcast and does not
  allow other podcast platforms to import your podcast. If you decide in the
  future to migrate away from Castopod to a new platform, this toggle will need
  to be unchecked.
- **Podcast should be hidden from public catalogues**: If toggled, a best effort
  is made to hide the entire podcast from appearing in Apple Podcasts, YouTube
  Music, and any other third party podcast apps. (Not guaranteed)
- **Podcast will not be having new episodes**: If your podcast comes to an end,
  you can toggle this to let listeners know there will not be new episodes.
