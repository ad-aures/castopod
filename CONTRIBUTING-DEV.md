# Setup your development environment

## Introduction

Castopod is a web app based on the `php` framework
[CodeIgniter 4](https://codeigniter.com).

We use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to quickly setup a dev environment. A
`docker-compose.yml` and `Dockerfile` are included in the project's root folder
to help you kickstart your contribution.

> You don't need any prior knowledge of Docker to follow the next steps.
> However, if you wish to use your own environment, feel free to do so!

## Setup instructions

### 1. Pre-requisites

0. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker).

1. Clone the Castopod repository by running:

   ```bash
   git clone https://code.castopod.org/adaures/castopod.git
   ```

2. Create a `.env` file with the minimum required config to connect the app to
   the database and use redis as a cache handler:

   ```ini
   CI_ENVIRONMENT="development"
   # If set to development, you must run `pnpm run dev` to start the static assets server
   vite.environment="development"

   # By default, this is set to true in the app config.
   # For development, this must be set to false as it is
   # on a local environment
   app.forceGlobalSecureRequests=false

   app.baseURL="http://localhost:8080/"

   admin.gateway="cp-admin"
   auth.gateway="cp-auth"

   database.default.hostname="mariadb"
   database.default.database="castopod"
   database.default.username="castopod"
   database.default.password="castopod"
   database.default.DBPrefix="dev_"

   analytics.salt="DEV_ANALYTICS_SALT"

   cache.handler="redis"
   cache.redis.host="redis"

   # You may not want to use redis as your cache handler
   # Comment/remove the two lines above and uncomment
   # the next line for file caching.
   # -----------------------
   #cache.handler="file"

   ######################################
   # Media config
   ######################################
   media.baseURL="http://localhost:8080/"

   # S3
   # Uncomment to store s3 objects using adobe/s3mock service
   # -----------------------
   #media.fileManager="s3"
   #media.s3.bucket="castopod"
   #media.s3.endpoint="http://172.31.0.6:9090/"
   #media.s3.pathStyleEndpoint=true
   ```

   > [!NOTE]  
   > You can tweak your environment by setting more environment variables in
   > your custom `.env` file. See the `env` for examples or the
   > [CodeIgniter4 User Guide](https://codeigniter.com/user_guide/index.html)
   > for more info.

3. (for Docker desktop) Add the repository you've cloned to Docker desktop's
   `Settings` > `Resources` > `File Sharing`

### 2. (recommended) Develop inside the app container with VSCode

If you're working in VSCode, you can take advantage of the `.devcontainer/`
folder. It defines a development environment (dev container) with preinstalled
requirements and VSCode extensions so you don't have to worry about them. All
required services will be loaded automagically! ðŸª„

1. Install the VSCode extension
   [Remote - Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)
2. `Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + P` > `Open in container`

   > The VSCode window will reload inside the dev container. Expect several
   > minutes during first load as it is building all necessary services.

   **Note**: The dev container will start by running Castopod's PHP server.
   During development, you will have to start [Vite](https://vitejs.dev)'s dev
   server for compiling the typescript code and styles:

   ```bash
   # run Vite dev server
   pnpm run dev --host
   ```

   If there is any issue with the PHP server not running, you can restart them
   using the following commands:

   ```bash
   # run Castopod server
   php spark serve - 0.0.0.0
   ```

3. You're all set! ðŸŽ‰

   You're now **inside the dev container**, you may use the VSCode console
   (`Terminal` > `New Terminal`) to run any command:

   ```bash
   # PHP is installed
   php -v

   # Composer is installed
   composer -V

   # pnpm is installed
   pnpm -v

   # git is installed
   git version
   ```

For more info, see
[Developing inside a Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers)

### 3. Start hacking

You're all set! Start working your magic by updating the project's files! Help
yourself to the
[CodeIgniter4 User Guide](https://codeigniter.com/user_guide/index.html) for
more insights.

To see your changes, go to:

- `http://localhost:8080/` for the Castopod website
- `http://localhost:8080/cp-admin` for the Castopod admin:

  - email: **admin@castopod.local**
  - password: **castopod**

- `http://localhost:8888/` for the phpmyadmin interface:

  - username: **castopod**
  - password: **castopod**

### 2-alt. Develop outside the app container

You do not wish to use the VSCode devcontainer? No problem!

1. Start the Docker containers manually:

   Go to the project's root folder and run:

   ```bash
   # starts all services declared in docker-compose.yml file
   # -d option starts the containers in the background
   docker-compose up -d

   # See all running processes (you should see 3 processes running)
   docker-compose ps

   # Alternatively, you can check all docker processes
   docker ps -a

   ```

   > The `docker-compose up -d` command will boot 5 containers in the
   > background:
   >
   > - `castopod_app`: a php based container with Castopod requirements
   >   installed
   > - `castopod_redis`: a [redis](https://redis.io/) database to handle queries
   >   and pages caching
   > - `castopod_mariadb`: a [mariadb](https://mariadb.org/) server for
   >   persistent data
   > - `castopod_phpmyadmin`: a phpmyadmin server to visualize the mariadb
   >   database.
   > - `castopod_s3`: a mock s3 server to work on the s3 fileManager

2. Run any command inside the containers by prefixing them with
   `docker-compose run --rm app`:

   ```bash
   # use PHP
   docker-compose run --rm app php -v

   # use Composer
   docker-compose run --rm app composer -V

   # use pnpm
   docker-compose run --rm app pnpm -v

   # use git
   docker-compose run --rm app git version
   ```

## Going Further

### Install Castopod's dependencies

1. Install php dependencies with [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)

   ```bash
   composer install
   ```

   > [!NOTE]  
   > The php dependencies aren't included in the repository. Composer will check
   > the `composer.json` and `composer.lock` files to download the packages with
   > the right versions. The dependencies will live under the `vendor/` folder.
   > For more info, check out the
   > [Composer documentation](https://getcomposer.org/doc/).

2. Install JavaScript dependencies with [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

   > [!NOTE]  
   > The JavaScript dependencies aren't included in the repository. Pnpm will
   > check the `package.json` and `pnpm-lock.yaml` files to download the
   > packages with the right versions. The dependencies will live under the
   > `node_module` folder. For more info, check out the
   > [PNPM documentation](https://pnpm.io/motivation).

3. Generate static assets:

   ```bash
   # build all static assets at once
   pnpm run build:static

   # build specific assets
   pnpm run build:icons
   pnpm run build:svg
   ```

   > [!NOTE]  
   > The static assets generated live under the `public/assets` folder, it
   > includes JavaScript, styles, images, fonts, icons and svg files.

### Initialize and populate database

> [!TIP]  
> You may skip this section if you go through the install wizard (go to
> `/cp-install`).

1. Build the database with the migrate command:

   ```bash
   # loads the database schema during first migration
   php spark migrate -all
   ```

   You may need to undo the migration (rollback):

   ```bash
   # rolls back database schema (deletes all tables and their content)
   php spark migrate:rollback
   ```

2. Populate the database with the required data:

   ```bash
   # Populates all required data
   php spark db:seed DevSeeder
   ```

   You may choose to add data separately:

   ```bash
   # Populates all categories
   php spark db:seed CategorySeeder

   # Populates all Languages
   php spark db:seed LanguageSeeder

   # Adds a superadmin with [admin@castopod.local / castopod] credentials
   php spark db:seed DevSuperadminSeeder
   ```

3. (optional) Populate the database with test data:

   - Populate with fake podcast analytics:

   ```bash
   php spark db:seed FakePodcastsAnalyticsSeeder
   ```

   - Populate with fake website analytics:

   ```bash
   php spark db:seed FakeWebsiteAnalyticsSeeder
   ```

### Useful docker / docker-compose commands

- Monitor the app container:

```bash
docker-compose logs --tail 50 --follow --timestamps app
```

- Interact with the Redis server using included redis-cli command:

```bash
docker exec -it castopod_redis redis-cli
```

- Monitor the Redis container:

```bash
docker-compose logs --tail 50 --follow --timestamps redis
```

- Monitor the mariadb container:

```bash
docker-compose logs --tail 50 --follow --timestamps mariadb
```

- Monitor the phpmyadmin container:

```bash
docker-compose logs --tail 50 --follow --timestamps phpmyadmin
```

- Restart docker containers:

```bash
docker-compose restart
```

- Destroy all containers, opposite of `up` command:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

- Rebuild app container:

```bash
docker-compose build app
```

[docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/) documentations for
more insights.

### Updating Documentation

Castopod's documentation is written in Markdown and uses the Astro Starlight
framework. To update Castopod's documentation, including the Getting Started
guide and User Guide:

1. Change directories to the `docs` directory and install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd docs/
   pnpm i
   ```

2. Start the documentation development server:

   ```bash
   pnpm run dev --host
   ```

3. The documentation development server runs on port 4321. In your browser visit
   `http://localhost:4321/docs`. If the page displays a 404 Not Found error,
   click on the Castopod logo in the upper left hand corner of the page and the
   documentation should load.

4. Edit the Markdown files with your documentation updates. The Astro Starlight
   development server will automatically update each time you save a change.

## Known issues

### Allocation failed - JavaScript heap out of memory

This happens when running `pnpm install`.

ðŸ‘‰ By default, docker might not have access to enough RAM. Allocate more memory
and run `pnpm install` again.

### (Linux) Files created inside container are attributed to root locally

You may use Linux user namespaces to fix this on your machine:

> [!NOTE]  
> Replace "username" with your local username

1. Go to `/etc/docker/daemon.json` and add:

   ```json
   {
     "userns-remap": "username"
   }
   ```

2. Configure the subordinate uid/guid:

   ```bash
   # in /etc/subuid
   username:1000:1
   username:100000:65536
   ```

   ```bash
   # in /etc/subgid
   username:1000:1
   username:100000:65536
   ```

3. Restart Docker:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart docker
   ```

4. That's it! Now, the root user in the container will be mapped to the user on
   your local machine, no more permission issues! ðŸŽ‰
